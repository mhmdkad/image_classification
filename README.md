# image_classification
Image classification by training an already pretrained Convolutional Neural Network


The task is to train an already pretrained Convolutional Neural Network architecture on a dataset, both given in canvas. The datasets contain images as input and class labels as target, thus you have to solve a Supervised Machine Learning Classification problem.

The dataset is divided into train, validation and test set, for which results are presented for all.
